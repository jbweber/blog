As I sit at my desk reading the last few chapters of
["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book I
wonder what software I actually plan to write in Rust. Will it be like all of
the other programming languages I've spent time learning which rarely get used.
Or will it be the catalyst that unlocks the "builder" in me allowing me to
create some of those awesome projects people are always showing off on blogs
like these?

## History

### The early years

I was exposed to computers early by my grandparents who had a Radioshack TRS-80,
but I mostly played the space invaders cartridge on that. A few years later
there was Oregon Trail on the Apple IIe in the 3rd grade computer lab. That was
followed by some attempts to type games in basic from the back of a magazine I
found in the school library that failed.

In the intervening years between the computer lab and finally getting my own
computer I used computers at school to type assignments, or at my friends house
to chat on AOL and play games, but never to try and program again.

That all changed one fateful friday night when my friends and I went to the
movies and saw ["Hackers"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/). As
unrealistic as the world in that movie ended up being it definitely pushed us
all (at the time anyway) to want to become computer hackers. I promptly went
home that night and opened the manual for my TI-85 calculator (the only computer
I had at the time) and began to learn "programming". I had a TI-85 because it
was required for my Alegbra 2 class, but I used it mostly for playing games.
It became quickly apparent that the progamming functions available on the
calculator weren't exciting. I couldn't see at all how someone had created the
breakout game I loved playing in ZShell. I quickly learned that ZShell games
were made in a langage called "assembly" and the TI-85 used Z80 assembly
language. I spent a few weeks of study hall time in the library learning about
this on [ticalc.org](https://ticalc.org) but at this point assembly was way out
of my capabilities.

After many months of work at the movies selling popcorn and cleaning up after
slobby movie goers I saved enough money for half of a computer after my parents
agreed to pay for the other half. In early 1996 I got my first computer a
Pentium 133 with 8MB of ram and a 1GB hard drive. I was woefully unskilled, but
that didn't stop me from heading out to the book store and buying the book I'd
been eyeing for some time; "Teach Yourself C in 21 days". I can say that while
I didn't learn C in 21 days, or really ever honestly (well enough to say I
"know C anyway") that book purchase probably got me to where I am today. Shortly
after getting the book and finding out I would need a compiler, my PC got Linux
installed the first time, and Windows 95 was rendered unusable for the first
time. These events mixed with trying to fix the broken computer before my dad
found out started my journey in technology.

### College

At this point I had read some books, typed some programs, and thought about
programming a lot. I however wouldn't say I had yet learned programming. I had
however sparked enough of an interest in computers that I decided instead of
every kids dream, being a marine biologist, I would pursue a degree in computer
science instead.

I found out quickly that computer science sure seemed to be a lot more about
learning math than different programming languages, and when we did actually do
some programming we spent most of our time talking about theory than about
language semantics. Hindsight being what it is, this makes a lot of sense now,
and realistically was useful foundation, but at the time it didn't make sense.

While we learned what everyone called [bastardized
C++](https://everything2.com/title/Resolve+C%252B%252B) at OSU I continued my
journey playing with Linux and veering off into OpenBSD and FreeBSD as well.
This pushed my skills in shell scripting quite a bit and introduced me to Perl
as well. While it didn't seem like it at the time I was learning my first real
programming as a side effect of doing systems administration on my PC with these
UNIX-like operating systems.

### Industry

Early on in college I got a job at a local ISP which pushed my boundaries quite
a bit as well. It was the late 90s and the ISP was strapped for cash so why not
pay college kids like $9 an hour to do everything. And when I say everything, I
mean *EVERYTHING*. Using the newly released Perl 5 and some old recycled sales
computers myself and a couple other employees wrote some actual software
including a trouble ticketing system which eventually grew all kinds of features
and became kind of a customer platform. From 1999 to 2001 I wrote probably a
hundred thousand lines of Perl, but at the time it didn't occur to me I had
"learned programming" and might actually be a software developer. Sure there
were a lot of techniques I didn't know, like unit testing, but just because
you're not an expert at something doesn't mean you're not doing that thing.

After running out of money and not being able to afford to finish college I
needed to find a better paying job. Using the skills I had I landed as a systems
administrator for big iron UNIX at a bank. It quickly became apparent we could
write some code to simplify our jobs here based on work I had done previously. A
few people on my team knew Perl and some others knew PHP. Just as quickly as we
started to build tools we quickly learned at a bank one doesn't program in
anything other than Java, and none of use understood that complex beast. We
started calling our programming scripting and our software became "just some
scripts" and I spent from ~2004 to 2009 as scripter, and even though I learned
Python in that time I wasn't "learning programming" I was scripting.

Java
C#
Go

## Wrap Up

After going through my history 

programmed professionally in Perl, PHP, Python, Java, C#, and Go

"learning programming" goes on forever
language is just a tool
any programming language can realistically solve any problem. prevented by ecosystem usually. for example writing a kernel in python 
learning languages must be a hobby now.


Maybe learning Rust won't be the catalyst to becoming a builder after all,
because I've been a builder all along. After introspecting on my history I can
definitley say I've learned programming over the years and while initially I
did it to solve real world problems, lately it looks like my hobby is learning
programming languages because their interesting and not just to solve a problem.

any language can solve any problem for the most part
learning language because it's interesting / feature / cs thing wasn't
interested in before
